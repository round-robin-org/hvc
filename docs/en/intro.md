## Toward a Theory of Value‑Emergence Systems

### Introduction — Hypotheses and Method

What drives the course of history? Is it material in nature, or is it born of ideas?
A materialist view of history holds that the mode of material production determines social structure, whereas an idealist view sees the human mind—thought, ideology—as the true engine of historical change.

Yet from a rigorously materialist standpoint, even the humans who generate ideas are themselves physical beings. Material and ideal, therefore, are not strict opposites; rather, they intertwine. History seems to incorporate both aspects inseparably. If so, we must ask: by what physical principles do potent ideas—especially the “values” that orient our actions—arise?

Intellectual history shows that understandings of value have shifted dramatically. In antiquity and the Middle Ages, Truth, Goodness, and Beauty (verum, bonum, pulchrum) were grasped as an integrated whole. In the modern era, these spheres differentiated and multiplied; today they appear thoroughly relativized. This raises anew the question: are values universal, or merely relative?

This essay contends that values possess both universality and relativity. By “universality” I do not mean a Platonic realm of transcendent forms; rather, I posit a transcendental form that makes all value‑judgment possible. Every concrete judgment, however, is rendered by a cognizing subject occupying a particular standpoint. More fundamentally, the one who recognizes and judges value is a self‑maintaining “existent.” If we probe the principles that allow existents—and living beings—to persist, we should find the transcendental form that underlies every value. That very form, I propose, is none other than Truth, Goodness, and Beauty themselves.

We cannot, however, apprehend the principle of existence directly. As Kant observed, our cognition is bounded by experience; things‑in‑themselves are in principle unknowable. Ultimately, to “know a fact” is indistinguishable from “the subject believing that fact to be so.” Thus “principle” may be better conceived not as an objective entity but as a transcendental demand—an axiomatic, speculative intuition that lets us construct a consistent web of beliefs about the world.

Accordingly, this essay does not begin from that unreachable principle itself. Instead, it starts by explicitly describing and analyzing our current belief‑system. In particular, it focuses on the meta‑level structure revealed by the very belief that “we hold a belief‑system.” Concretely, I describe in formal terms how perception and cognition configure the world and cause values to emerge.

Through this method I aim to approach the root of value’s dual nature and the dynamical principles of history. Crucially, our direct experiential objects are always ideas, not the dynamics themselves. Therefore idealist perspectives are profoundly practical—provided they are coupled with an understanding of the material mechanics that generate those ideas. Such an idealism, grounded in its material underpinnings, yields firmer practical power.
