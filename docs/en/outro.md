## Afterword
This essay originates from an awareness of the problem concerning 'value'—a central theme in philosophy since ancient times, yet one whose universality is wavering in the modern era, becoming elusive amidst the currents of relativism. Does the driving force of history lie in its material foundations, or in human ideas? This confrontational axis between materialism and idealism, too, proves inadequate for grasping the complexity of modern society through simple dualism, demanding reconsideration.  This essay is an attempt to address these fundamental questions by re-examining the three classical values of 'Truth, Goodness, and Beauty' (真善美) from a contemporary perspective, reconstructing them within an integrative framework that connects life, society, history, and technology.  

This endeavor commenced in Chapter 1, "Fundamental Value Construction," by deriving the universal forms of 'Truth, Goodness, and Beauty' from the principle that life pursues a 'harmonious reality,' referencing recent scientific findings such as the Free Energy Principle and Bayesian Mechanics. Subsequently, Chapter 2, "Materialistic Value Construction," extended this principle to the analysis of society and history.  It traced the historical transformations of social structures by reinterpreting Hannah Arendt's 'worldliness' from an information-theoretic perspective through the concept of an 'Artificial Markov Blanket (AMB)' and by reinterpreting Kojin Karatani's theory of modes of exchange as 'materialistic modes of dependency' grounded in technological and informational foundations.  Furthermore, it suggested the possibility that the development of control technologies, including AI, relativizes material constraints and could prompt a transition towards an 'idealistic history' where human 'ideas' become the primary drivers of historical change.  Finally, Chapter 3, "Practical Value Construction," addressed the practical challenges of this new stage—starting from the fundamental reality of the naturalness of birth, discussing value judgments within pragmatism and constructivist methodologies, and emphasizing the importance of democratic consensus-building. It ultimately concluded that the 'harmonious composition of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty' is the very guideline we should aspire to.

The question consistently pursued throughout this essay is how to discover and implement a harmonious balance among Truth, Goodness, and Beauty, without undue emphasis on any single value.  As argued in Chapter 3, an overemphasis on 'Goodness' carries the risk of devolving into impractical self-righteousness, akin to anti-natalism; an overemphasis on 'Truth' can lead to nihilistic stagnation; and an overemphasis on 'Beauty' risks descending into anarchism lacking viable alternatives.  Overcoming the diverse challenges confronting modern society—such as the ethical application of technology, consensus-building in social design, and the coexistence of pluralistic values—demands precisely the wisdom to synthesize and harmonize these three values.

Naturally, I am cognizant that many challenges remain regarding the arguments developed in this essay.  In particular, the application and analogies drawn from scientific theories such as the Free Energy Principle and universal criticality are presented merely as 'scaffolding' or 'analogies' for inquiry within the humanities and social sciences.  The rigorousness of these theoretical connections necessitates further future investigation. Moreover, verifying the validity of concepts introduced, such as 'modes of dependency,' 'AMB,' and 'critical society,' will necessitate more precise definitions, concrete case analyses, and linkage to empirical research.

Nevertheless, I would be gratified if the endeavor of this essay—which sought to re-examine the foundations of value and society from an interdisciplinary perspective, taking into account contemporary technological and social transformations, and attempting to shed light on the classical yet timely challenge of achieving the 'harmony of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty'—proves to possess some measure of significance.  In an age where the notion of an 'idealistic history' might be acquiring tangible relevance, the questions of which values we choose to uphold, what kind of society we envision, and how we strive to realize it are becoming ever more critical.  It is my sincere hope that this essay may serve as food for thought, aiding esteemed readers in their reflections upon these significant questions. With this wish, I conclude my writing.
