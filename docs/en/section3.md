## Chapter 3: Practical Value Construction

In the previous chapter (Chapter 2: Materialistic Value Construction), we attempted to re-examine "materialistically" how the evolution of technological and informational foundations has historically transformed society's "modes of dependency (modes of exchange)." Furthermore, in the contemporary era where advanced control technologies, including AI, are proliferating, we suggested the possibility that material constraints are being relativized, and we are in a transitional period towards an "idealistic history" where the "ideas" (values and ideals) we choose to construct society with are paramount. There, the practical question arises of how to weave the values of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty into social reality. This chapter focuses precisely on this dimension of "practice."

## 3.1 The Naturalness of Birth
> Labor and work, as well as action, are also rooted in natality in so far as they have the task to provide and preserve the world for, to foresee and reckon with, the constant influx of newcomers who are born into the world as strangers.
Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition   

When discussing idealistic history, there is a crucial point to consider: the inherent "self-propagating nature" (自己増殖性) of life. The self-propagation of life forms the "world of the species" (種の世界) and becomes the source of its pluralistic harmony (多元的調和). In other words, the "birth" (出生) of life sends new generations into the world of the species, influencing existing value systems while generating pluralistic harmony – it is a fundamental condition for this.

However, what I want to assert here is not that "birth has inherent value." From the standpoint of this essay, birth itself has no a priori value; there is only "the reality of birth." All pursuit of value exists only within the "reality of being alive," its origin lies precisely in the moment of birth, and no value whatsoever can be established before that.

Of course, as living individuals, we can establish values regarding birth. However, I believe there is no direct connection between such constructed value systems and the value-neutrality of birth itself.

In reality, whether one tries to affirm or deny birth, the reality of birth continues to occur ceaselessly due to life's self-propagating nature. Affirming birth merely reaffirms its naturalness and does not hold significance as value theory. Conversely, denying birth, as long as the birth of "sentient beings" (有感的存在) (beings with sensation), not just current life, is natural, tends to end up as practically powerless wishful thinking. In short, regardless of individual intentions, if the conditions are met, birth occurs as a reality, and society begins to generate new mutual harmony (相互調和) with the newcomers. Thus, all ideological stances surrounding birth—for instance, arguments like anti-natalism, which claims "it is better not to be born," or conversely, assertions that "birth should be unconditionally celebrated"—ultimately face the reality of self-propagation, "birth continues to happen regardless," making it difficult to attain definitive legitimacy beyond the realm of speculation.

Certainly, the logic of anti-natalism may seem strongly persuasive at first glance. However, this mechanism can be understood as an "overemphasis on Goodness" (善の偏重). That is, it is merely a self-righteous judgment lacking the "pursuit of Beauty" and the "pursuit of Truth."

First, the anti-natalist places principled goodness on the postulate.

> (1) the presence of pain is bad, and  
(2) the presence of pleasure is good.  
However, such symmetrical evaluation does not seem to apply to the absence of pain and pleasure, for it strikes me as true that:  
(3) the absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone, whereas,  
(4) the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.  
David Benatar, Better Never to Have Been   

And from this asymmetry, Benatar derives the conclusion that "non-existence is always preferable to existence," meaning "coming into existence is always a harm."

Since such logic presupposes a fundamental Good, it is difficult to refute head-on. However, there is no need to refute it head-on in the first place; this is merely an "overemphasis on Goodness." From the perspective of this essay, this is a self-righteous judgment lacking the "pursuit of Beauty" and the "pursuit of Truth," and can be called a value judgment lacking practicality. It clearly lacks the pursuit of Beauty in that it undervalues the happiness of life.

On the other hand, it lacks the pursuit of Truth in that it implicitly assumes the artificiality (人為性) of birth and never questions this premise. If birth were assumed to be natural, the method of anti-birth would weaken in practical significance, and the meaning of anti-natalism's value judgment would inevitably be shaken. Despite this, many anti-natalist arguments seem to stand on the premise that birth is the result of artificial choice, without sufficient consideration of the validity of the premise itself or the aspect of the naturalness of birth.

Therefore, let's conduct a thought experiment about a world where the fundamental power of life's (inherently natural) self-propagation can be completely controlled artificially (人為的に). There, comprehensive "population design" (人口デザイン) regarding population size and the attributes of the next generation would become possible.

However, even in that situation, the plurality of values (価値観の多元性) would not disappear; rather, new conflicts are anticipated concerning the pros and cons of control, its methods, and ethical aspects. This is because fundamental questions would be raised, such as the possibility that technology use could infringe on the dignity and free will of life, and the mediation between the value pursuits of society as a whole and those of individuals.

Even if birth control technology were established, diverse relationships and desires would surely not be unified. Consequently, conflicts over pluralistic values regarding the application of technology would be unavoidable. Especially if the decision-making power to manage birth becomes concentrated in specific authorities or organizations, severe social and political power relations would arise, potentially making conflicts more serious than in the real world.

Therefore, a situation of "complete control," while seemingly overcoming problems, actually becomes a source of new value conflicts. The core questions become: "For what purpose, by whom, and how is birth control to be exercised?"—centering on the locus, exercise, and justification of the "power" (権能) of control. Ultimately, the "design philosophy" (設計思想)—concerning the attribution of authority for birth choices and the appropriateness of societal/state intervention—must be questioned as the value norm that fundamentally defines that society.

Overall, in a hypothetical world where birth becomes "artificial," "higher-order value issues" (高次の価値争点) arise concerning the exercise and justification of control power, and all ideological positions regarding birth take on an extremely strong "political nature" (政治性). Even in a different guise from the real world where self-propagation is considered natural, we would have no choice but to continue the endeavor of generating new mutual harmony under pluralistic harmony.

In the end, whether birth is natural or artificial, we must continue to seek harmony amidst pluralistic values. Re-evaluating anti-natalism in light of this universal challenge, it is a value judgment that possesses absolutely no practicality in fulfilling the ethical responsibility for the suffering of future generations it purports to consider.

Furthermore, one might say it is problematic in that its superficial persuasiveness distances people from more constructive discussions. The greatest tragedy of all is to live while feeling the pain of the constantly continuing relative value conflicts from infancy through growth, forgetting the fundamental harmony of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty, and still being dazzled by biased, self-righteous judgments like anti-natalism.

### 3.2 The Law of Minimum Cost
Birth is promised, suffering (苦痛) is fated (宿命的), and harmony (調和) is destined (運命的). The Good that can be practiced therein is none other than the minimization of suffering (苦痛の最小化). This essay wishes to grasp this "Law of Minimum Cost towards Fated Harmony" as the essence of pragmatism (プラグマティズム). Since pragmatism originates from a pluralistic view of truth (多元的真理観), it does not believe that there is a Good that functions absolutely for any problem.

The reality we live in already exists as pluralistic harmony, and the various problems in reality are nothing other than the process of generating mutual harmony that proceeds under this pluralistic harmony. There, no matter what principle of action is applied, it cannot continue to function as absolute Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.

For example, deontological (義務論的) action, when adhering rigidly to specific synchronic values (existing norms), easily falls into a cycle of blind self-justification aimed at maintaining the status quo. As a result, it can create conflicts that hinder the potential for new mutual harmony and unnecessarily amplify the inevitable difficulties (evil - 悪) accompanying the generation process. Also, an attitude indifferent to all consequences will often be regarded as self-righteous (独善的).

On the other hand, utilitarianism (功利主義) estimates the mutual harmony between heterogeneous multiple subjects and selects actions to maximize the overall benefit. However, it sometimes faces criticism for justifying disadvantages (evil - 悪) that threaten established harmony as a "necessary evil" in the process.

The problem-form of value conflicts related to these principles of action is universal, particularly manifesting in fields like medicine and public health as issues of decision-making directly concerning life. Of course, turning away from these problems and taking no action is also merely a "fundamental evil" (原理的な悪), simply waiting for one's own harmonious reality to gradually diminish.

Our lives are existences that constantly face the dilemma of self-righteousness and dogmatism (独断性) inherent universally in principles of action like deontology and utilitarianism, within the process of generating mutual harmony that continually unfolds on the stage of historically developed pluralistic harmony, and that continuously attempt to overcome this.

Pragmatism is the formation of knowledge and modes of conduct that produce the highest degree of generalization and the maximum adaptation to specific events, though not absolute. This is an unending pursuit of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty, and is a deontological principle of action based on diachronic values (universal Truth, Goodness, and Beauty).

Pragmatism identifies meaning with habit formation, that is, the formation of a mode of action that enables the highest degree of generalization, and the maximum scope of adaptation to the particular.
John Dewey, "The Pragmatism of Peirce" (Translation based on Japanese text)

For example, there is the value norm of "fairness" (公平性). This is not a primitive value, and it is probably difficult to logically derive that fairness is good. This is because fairness is not an absolute good. However, many people feel (or intuitively accept) that fairness is good. In essence, fairness can be interpreted as minimizing the overall opportunity cost in the process of generating mutual harmony. But even before such reasoning, it is a value norm cultivated through history that is generally considered good.

In this way, we are beings who have inherited from past people a legacy of "methodologies for harmony" (調和の方法論) that are not absolute but are general. And similarly, if we are to consider the suffering of future generations, developing this methodology is crucial. Developing methodology means putting it into practice. In other words, us living happily ourselves is the primary condition for minimizing the suffering of future generations.

### 3.3 Theory of Value Co-creation Systems
Regarding the "constructivist method" (構成論的方法) mentioned in the previous chapter, I want to clarify the challenges from the perspective of practice within pluralistic harmony. When applying the constructivist method to real-world problems, it is necessary to be aware that the act of application itself carries a utilitarian character.

In fact, the "systems approach" (システムズアプローチ), which seeks to discover and solve problems using modeling and simulation techniques, has been applied in various social domains. However, using this methodology always carries the risk of falling into dogmatism (独断).

This is because the moment analysis and judgment using the systems approach begin, transaction costs are already incurred by the stakeholders. Furthermore, the process of estimating counterfactual mutual harmony within limited costs and time, and deciding on measures based solely on that estimation, easily breeds utilitarian dogmatism.

While utilitarianism emphasizes quantifying and comparing "how much benefit or happiness is expected for whom," it is natural that the truthfulness and validity of the estimation methods serving as the basis are questioned. In other words, the most crucial point in making utilitarian judgments boils down to how to verify the validity of the estimation methods themselves.

This potential problematic awareness within utilitarianism becomes even more apparent in "Evidence-Based Policy Making" and William MacAskill's "Effective Altruism" (効果的利他主義).

However, even at the stage of verifying the validity of estimation methods, the danger of falling into dogmatism is unavoidable. If validity is evaluated solely based on "rationality" (合理性) grounded in a monistic view of truth (一元的真理観) unaware of the relativity of truth, then in situations where real-world pluralistic values and interests are intertwined (pluralistic harmony), one might face a situation where that "rational" judgment is not necessarily accepted or workable.

Here, "not workable" does not simply mean "theoretically flawed." Rather, it points to the possibility that no matter how much rational evidence is gathered, the measure may become impracticable due to social norms, the consensus-building process, or emotional resistance. For example, even when introducing the same policy, the outcome can change completely depending on "trivial circumstances" like whether stakeholder agreement was obtained beforehand. Such "irrationality" might be incomprehensible to rationalists brandishing a monistic view of truth. However, it is one manifestation of an "overemphasis on Truth" (真の偏重), neglecting aspects of Goodness (social agreement, moral norms) and Beauty (emotions, motivation, empathy, etc.), making it rational but impractical.

Therefore, to justify utilitarian actions, not only the results of the estimation but also a democratic verification process (民主的な検証プロセス) concerning the estimation process itself—considering pluralistic values, i.e., the perspectives of "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty" respectively—becomes indispensable. Enabling this is the core significance of "democracy" (民主主義), which is principled on a pluralistic view of truth.

That said, it is also true that attempting to implement ideal democratic processes in every situation incurs enormous transaction costs (time, expense). Here, the key lies in the "information-theoretic worldliness" (情報理論的世界性) suggested in the previous chapter. In the modern era, where information and communication infrastructure has developed and the marginal cost of communication has decreased, it is becoming possible to consider measures while incorporating diverse perspectives on a large scale using digital technology. Indeed, the practice of "digital democracy" (デジタル民主主義), which underpins the philosophy of "pluralism" (多元主義) demonstrated by figures like Audrey Tang (オードリー・タン), can be seen as an inevitable trend emerging against the backdrop of this technological infrastructure development.

As described above, when applying constructivist science to the problems of real society, an attitude is required that guards against the "utilitarian dogmatism" generated by the estimation process and results, while complementing its validity through a process of pluralistic consensus-building. By doing so, a path opens up that avoids bias towards merely the "pursuit of Truth" and aims for harmony with the "pursuit of Goodness" and the "pursuit of Beauty."

### 3.4 The Harmonious Composition of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty
As has been discussed thus far, the pursuit of the three values—Truth, Goodness, and Beauty—can lead to extreme dogmatism or practical stagnation if biased towards any single one. Therefore, harmonizing these three is the most crucial element in value judgment.

For example, leaning too heavily on "Goodness" can lead to extreme positions like anti-natalism, which views birth itself as an absolute evil, however persuasive it might seem at first glance.

On the other hand, valuing "Truth" excessively leads to the "nihilism" (虚無主義) pointed out by Nietzsche. Nihilism is the situation where what people have long regarded as the highest values become valueless. This is close to the state of realizing "there is no such thing as truth" at the end of pursuing truth, and can be described as a figure that has lost the sensitivity required for Beauty and the spirit and drive indispensable for the pursuit of Goodness. However, Nietzsche advocated for "active nihilism" (能動的ニヒリズム), which overcomes existing values to create new ones. This can be considered an attempt to bring about a new harmony of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.

Furthermore, an overemphasis on "Beauty," out of excessive respect for individual freedom and diversity, can lead towards "anarchism" (アナーキズム), which rejects existing authorities and institutions but lacks alternative practices. In recent years, however, a new trend, arguably termed "technological anarchism" (技術的アナーキズム), has emerged, represented by initiatives like those of Audrey Tang, which introduces rational and technological methods. There, by utilizing information technology to achieve realistic and democratic consensus-building, a new horizon is being opened for efforts that synthesize Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.

Ultimately, one might say that one of the important roles of human "education" (教育) lies in passing down to posterity the methodology for aiming towards the harmony of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty through one's own efforts. The power to think for oneself in pursuit of Truth, the power to refine sensitivity in pursuit of Beauty, the power to act in pursuit of Goodness—synthesizing these and demonstrating a figure living happily oneself can itself become the most practical education from predecessors to newcomers.

Furthermore, the job of philosophers specializing in value theory, in particular, is to show the path towards harmony and help overcome troubling values should they arise due to imbalance. However, what has been discussed here is the "Law of Minimum Cost towards Fated Harmony"—something that, so to speak, transcends the limits of language, about which one must remain silent.
