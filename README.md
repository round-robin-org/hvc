# Harmonious Value Constructivism (HVC)

> **An information‑theoretic framework that unifies epistemic (Truth), ethical (Goodness), and aesthetic (Beauty) value as a single self‑organising feedback loop.**

HVC extends the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to describe how living and social systems recursively construct value while minimising surprise. By restating value dynamics in terms of variational free energy, HVC offers:

* A quantitative grammar linking physics, cognition, and social evolution.
* A principled route to design artificial and organisational systems that remain adaptive, robust, and *harmonious*.

## Core Cycle
| Stage | Intuition | Computational reading |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Probabilistic World** | Reality begins as latent uncertainty. | A generative process with hidden states |
| **Self‑Organisation** | Systems carve out boundaries that stabilise them. | Markov blankets minimise free energy |
| **Computational Universality** | Critical regimes enable open‑ended structure. | Effective Turing‑complete dynamics |
| **Differentiable World Models** | Internal models become amenable to gradient descent. | End‑to‑end learning of priors and policies |
| **Inference = Perception + Action** | Acting is selecting the world one wishes to inhabit. | Policy selection by expected free energy |
| **Value Loop** | Truth → Goodness → Beauty → Truth … | Trade‑offs: predictability, viability, exploration |

These phases iterate across scales, yielding layers—from cells and neural circuits to economies and cultures.

## Exchange Modes Revisited
Building on Karatani Kojin, HVC interprets the canonical exchange modes **A Reciprocity**, **B Redistribution**, **C Market**, and **D Association** as *dependency modes*: distinct free‑energy‑minimising solutions under different material and informational constraints. This perspective clarifies historical transitions and supports simulation of alternative futures.
