# Harmonious Value Constructivism (HVC) / 調和的価値構成論

> **Uniting Truth, Goodness, and Beauty under an Active‑Inference view of history and value.**

HVC is an open research programme that re‑examines the genealogy of value—how it arises, stabilises, and transforms—through the lens of the Free Energy Principle. It departs from the classic separation of epistemic, ethical, and aesthetic domains and re‑integrates them as different *momenta* in a single adaptive process.

## Three‑Tier Value Construction (1〜3章の構成)
| Layer | Guiding Question | Key Mechanism |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **1. 原理的価値構成 (Principled)** | *What formal structure makes any value judgement possible?* | Prior beliefs that minimise *surprise* provide the transcendental grammar for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. |
| **2. 唯物的価値構成 (Material)** | *How do material constraints shape the emergence of value?* | Exchange modes (A Reciprocity, B Redistribution, C Market, D Association) appear as dependency regimes solving free‑energy minimisation under specific techno‑ecological conditions. |
| **3. 実践的価値構成 (Practical)** | *How can societies intentionally cultivate harmonious value today?* | Policy design framed as active inference: agents update beliefs, enact preferred futures, and re‑write the landscape of possible values. |

This stratified view replaces older “core‑cycle” diagrams. Readers are encouraged to start with *1.1 Universal Form of Truth‑Goodness‑Beauty* in Chapter 1, where the argument is laid out most compactly.

## Historical Dynamics
HVC recasts Karatani Kojin’s exchange‑mode theory in probabilistic terms, revealing historical transitions as phase shifts in collective belief networks. The framework predicts when and how a new mode—beyond the traditional A–D—might crystallise.

## Current Repository
This repo contains drafts, code experiments, and discussion threads. The structure will evolve as the project crystallises.
